Sir Isaac Newton, a devout Christian, had a close friend who was an atheist. 
One day, Newton invited him over to his study. 
As the friend entered, he noticed a beautifully crafted model of the solar system—made of gold and other fine materials. 
The planets were positioned accurately and moved in perfect harmony.

Amazed, the friend asked, “This is incredible! Who made it?"
Newton calmly replied, “No one. It just formed itself—particles randomly came together to create it.”
The friend laughed and said, “Come on, that's impossible. Someone clearly designed and built this!”

Newton looked at him and said, “If you can't believe that this small model came about by chance, 
then how can you believe that the real solar system, infinitely more complex and vast, 
came into existence without a Creator?"
